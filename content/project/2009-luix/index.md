It is demonstrated that a good management of city and road illumination could permit to drastically reduce the related energy consumption.
In that line, in collaboration with the Luix company, we have been working on the design of a vision-based presence detection technique, that would permit to adjust accordingly the intensity of the street lamp leds.
