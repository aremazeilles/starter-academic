In collaboration with the company Auralia, we have been working on a vision-based audio-guide, in which the paintings are automatically detected by the audio-guide through image processing.
That permits to automatically launch the audio description related to the observed painting. A pose estimation is also used to enrich the audio description with some 3D spatial resolution.

The details of this work are unfortunately confidential.
