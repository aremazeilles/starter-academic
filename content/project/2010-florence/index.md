It is considered that assistive robots could provide elderly people with a physical and cognitive support that would permit to live longer independently in their home.

In that context we have been contributing to different projects aiming at designing some mobile robot assistants providing different kind of supports to the elderly.

Our contribution in that line mainly relies on the preparation of robotic enablers, in which the interaction with the mobile platform is abstracted for facilitating the use of the robot within the higher-level mechanisms.
