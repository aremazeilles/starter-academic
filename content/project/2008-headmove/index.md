The objective of this work is to give to persons with strong physical disabilities the access to electric wheelchairs that would permit them to increase their mobility and independence.
Persons with spinal cord injury have their mobility capacities restricted to the head, which makes the control of traditional wheelchairs impossible. We proposed a control mechanism based on the visual tracking of the head motion.
