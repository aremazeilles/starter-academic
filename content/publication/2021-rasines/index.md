abstract: "This study aims to evaluate different combinations of features and algorithms to be used in the control of a prosthetic hand wherein both the configuration of the fingers and the gripping forces can be controlled. This requires identifying machine learning algorithms and feature sets to detect both intended force variation and hand gestures in EMG signals recorded from upper-limb amputees. However, despite the decades of research into pattern recognition techniques, each new problem requires researchers to find a suitable classification algorithm, as there is no such thing as a universal ’best’ solution. Consideration of different techniques and data representation represents a fundamental practice in order to achieve maximally effective results. To this end, we employ a publicly-available database recorded from amputees to evaluate different combinations of features and classifiers. Analysis of data from 9 different individuals shows that both for classic features and for time-dependent power spectrum descriptors (TD-PSD) the proposed logarithmically scaled version of the current window plus previous window achieves the highest classification accuracy. Using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) as a classifier and applying a majority-voting strategy to stabilize the individual window classification, we obtain 88% accuracy with classic features and 89% with TD-PSD features."
