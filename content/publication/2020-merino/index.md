abstract: "This article deals with the 2D image-based recognition of industrial parts. Methods based on histograms are well known and widely used, but it is hard to find the best combination of histograms, most distinctive for instance, for each situation and without a high user expertise. We proposed a descriptor subset selection technique that automatically selects the most appropriate descriptor combination, and that outperforms approach involving single descriptors. We have considered both backward and forward mechanisms. Furthermore, to recognize the industrial parts a supervised classification is used with the global descriptors as predictors. Several class approaches are compared. Given our application, the best results are obtained with the Support Vector Machine with a combination of descriptors increasing the F1 by 0.031 with respect to the best descriptor "
