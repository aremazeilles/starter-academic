I am a researcher and project manager at [Tecnalia](http://www.tecnalia.com), Donostia, in the Spanish basque country.
I work in the Medical Robotics group, from the Health Division, as well as in the Advanced Manufacturing group of the Industry and Transport Division.
I am involved in the development of technological solutions for physical Human Robot interaction, vision-based robotic manipulation, ... I am also very interested in  software architecture, within (or without) the ROS framework.
